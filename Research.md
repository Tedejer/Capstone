## Approach

### Human Centerd Design

[Design Kit](https://www.designkit.org/human-centered-design)

_A practical, repeatable approach to arriving at innovative solutions._

This design consists of three phases:

1. Inspiration
1. Ideation
1. Implementation

The main heart of the process is to keep the stakeholders a part of the project at each part of the development.

Problems people face when looking for chairty / volunteer work

- Where it is located
- How the money is being used

## Tech Stack

A tech stack is defined as the set of technologies an organization uses to build a web or mobile application. It is a combination of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, patterns, servers, UI/UX solutions, software, and tools used by its developers.

## Typescript

### What is Typescript?

Strongly typed programming language that builds on top of Javascript giving better tooling at any scale.

### Why use it?

- It is easier to refactor code without breaking it significantly
- Scalability
- Readability
- Preventive measures to avoid bugs and errors
- It is widly used in the industry today

### Preq to understanding Typescript is understanding Javascript

## Meeting Notes

**Meeting Format**

1. Talk about MVP show wireframe / what we have made
2. Talk about what we are doing around human centred design getting data
3. Experimental concepts that we can maybe try to implement if it is logical viable or possible

**Feb 10**

Idea 1:

- Change focus from a metric based project to a more focus on "discoverability" based project
- Our Main page, getting the Search Bar to find Charities more easily
- The metrics based idea we had will be more of a side project/fun feature
- Justin Gallo's idea: be able to filter/search for a time frame, which will show the Charities running
  at those times

Idea 2:

- Sergio's idea: make our project "Competitive" but still not against the whole idea of volunteering for Charities
- Using a point system to slowly unlock features on the app, such as metrics, scheduling, "news section"
  - at the beginning, the Dashboard of new users will be bare, will give a motivation to be more involved
    - will use the idea of curiosity
  - will have conditions that will need to be met, to avoid people being dishonest and against the honor based system
- for fun, an achievement system

Subidea:

- From Benjamin's feedback, for the whole graph on the metrics, either keep track on displaying both the monetary inputs
  or volunteer hours together or separately
- For now, an honor system will be used in terms of verification

Questions:

- Feedback or ideas for verification
