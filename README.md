## About

A website that people in the local area of Ventura County can use to become a more generous, kind, philanthropic person all around. Aimed at making a person an overall better person and helping them find charities or community service events in the area of Ventura County. Colleges aim to educate people but don’t really teach people how to be better people to society, so one problem we discussed was students who do want to help and donate to charities or participate in beach clean ups and other communal events don’t really know where to go to find charities or events in the local area of Ventura County.
