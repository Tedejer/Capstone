Static front-end webpages are now located under the `resources`/`front-end` folder

Server side code is put into its own directory in the `root` directory

Front-end react code still lives witin the `charity-islands` folder

### Running Server

To view the front-end and back end connections both servers must be running at the same time

- To run backend server `cd` into server directory then run `npm start`
- To run frontend react server `cd` into `charity-islands` directory then run `npm start`

Port `3000` will be occupied by the react front end 
Port `3001` will be used when running the back end server
